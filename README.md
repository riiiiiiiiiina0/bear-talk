# 🐻‍❄️💬 Bear Talk

A one‑trick, very helpful bear: use selected browser tabs as context for your AI chats. No more re‑typing long explanations—your AI already knows what you’re talking about.

**Works with your existing AI chatbox—ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, Perplexity. No extra subscription or API key required.**
