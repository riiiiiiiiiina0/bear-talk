# 🗂️💬 TabTalk

A browser extension for any **Chromium-based browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) that lets you **chat with your open browser tabs**. Because it piggybacks on the ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude/Perplexity service you already using, there's **no extra subscription to buy and no API keys to paste** – just use the LLM service you already pay for. Select a couple of pages, hit the extension action button and watch them appear inside ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude/Perplexity as handy Markdown attachments. Perfect for asking things like:

- "Summarise these docs"
- "Compare these products"
- "Explain this blog post like I'm 5"
