### 🧃 Why Bear Talk?

Because tabs are like honey pots: they pile up fast, they’re easy to get lost in, and sometimes you need a bear to help sort them out.

### 🐻 Install & Go

No complicated setup, no hibernation required. Just add Bear Talk to your browser, connect your favorite AI, and you’re chatting with tabs in seconds.

### 🍯 Feedback & Support

Bears love feedback almost as much as honey. Got ideas? Bugs? Love letters? \[Open an issue] or give the bear a virtual hug.
